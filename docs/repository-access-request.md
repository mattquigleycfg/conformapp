# Repository Access Request

## Current Issue
I'm currently unable to commit changes to the branch I'm working on. The error message indicates that I don't have permission to commit to this branch.

## Request Details
- **Repository Name**: conformApp
- **Branch Name**: main
- **Access Needed**: Write access to the repository or specific branch
- **Reason**: Need to implement product import functionality from CSV to Supabase database
- **Timeline**: Required immediately - blocking product data import implementation

## User Information
- **Name**: Matt Quigley (mattquigleycfg)
- **Email**: matt@con-formgroup.com.au
- **Role/Department**: Design Department

## Project Impact
The product import functionality is a critical component for our application, allowing us to:
1. Import our existing product library into the Supabase database
2. Create relationships between products for the BOM export feature
3. Enable product search and filtering in the application

Without write access, I cannot commit the CSV import utility and database setup scripts needed for this functionality.

## Requested Access Level
- [ ] Read access
- [x] Write access
- [ ] Admin access

## Administrator Actions
Please grant write access to the main branch or advise if I should:
1. Create a feature branch I can commit to
2. Use a fork-and-pull-request workflow
3. Other recommended approach

Please provide the necessary access so I can contribute to the project.

Thank you.
